## Beating the market
--- 

**What Does It Mean to Beat the Market?**
- The phrase "beating the market" refers to an investor or corporation achieving better results than an industry standard. This could involve a market participant selecting stocks through an actively managed mutual fund (MTF), or achieving a return greater than the market itself. Alternative investments such as real estate, whiskey, or cryptocurrencies also fall into this category. For example, according to IG Group, the total return (assuming that dividends are reinvested) for FTSE 100 investors over the past decade is +103.98%.
 
**Is It Possible to Beat the Market?**

- Berkshire Hathaway's chief, Warren Buffett, has consistently achieved such results. However, devising a strategy to beat the market is challenging. It requires a lot of time, effort, and sometimes even thumping the desk in frustration. There's no guarantee that all this hard work will pay off. Nonetheless, it's not impossible. Investors just need to set realistic expectations and understand how unlikely it is to start beating the market immediately after beginning their investment journey.
 
**What Percentage of Investors Beat the Market?**
- According to the S&P Indices Versus Active (SPIVA) scorecard, for example, more than 95% of all domestic active stock fund managers underperformed their respective S&P benchmarks over the 20-year period through 2021.
 
**How to Beat the Market**
1. Dedicate time and maintain motivation to conduct thorough research.
2. Possess industry-related knowledge.
3. Understand trading psychology.

**Alternative to Beating the Market**

- A sensible decision for many people is to invest in a low-cost index tracker, like the FTSE 100 one mentioned above. If history serves as a guide, then over the long term, an index tracker will likely outperform the majority of managed funds and most other private investors.
